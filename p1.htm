style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><BR>Study Abroad is an educational 
option in which many College of Engineering undergraduates are interested and we 
encourage them to do so as a means of broadening their education and developing 
a global view of engineering. International study can be enlightening and 
fulfilling, both personally and academically, but it requires a good deal of 
organization and self-motivation to be successful.<BR><BR>We believe the 
benefits are well worth the effort for many students. These guidelines should 
enable you to develop a program that meets your needs and complements your 
undergraduate engineering education.<BR><BR>Students must obtain approval from 
the College of Engineering Associate Dean prior to engaging in any Study Abroad 
Program. EAP students are considered to be enrolled in the College of 
Engineering and these semesters count toward the semester limit for 
graduation.<BR><BR><B><BR></B></SPAN><B><A name=1></A><SPAN 
class=subsectiontitle1 style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Who Can Study 
Abroad</SPAN></B><SPAN 
style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><B><BR></B><BR>International study is 
full of potential rewards and opportunities for growth. It is also not right for 
everyone. Interested students must be honest with themselves about their 
openness and flexibility, desire to interact, and ability to notice differences 
and enjoy learning about new points-of-view without being judgmental. Although 
independence is important, in terms of responsibility, maturity and 
self-motivation, study abroad is not simply an exercise in self-reliance, but an 
opportunity to become an active, educated participant in our global community. A 
good dose of self-confidence and humor is also helpful when you have no idea 
what you are eating, the showers are just too "unique," your senses are over 
loaded, or you are exhausted from striving to be so open-minded.<BR><BR>Study 
abroad is also about being an ambassador. You become a part of very complex and 
delicate relationships between the College of Engineering, Berkeley, the UC 
system, and the host university and country. What you do WILL affect the options 
other students have in the future. Please remember your responsibility and think 
about your opportunities to represent yourself and all of us well.<BR><BR>You 
should check with the EAP Office for the GPA requirements needed to be eligible 
for the various programs. We expect you to be making normal degree progress and 
will review your standing before approving a semester or year abroad. It is also 
very important that interested students become familiar with the College of 
Engineering, EAP and UCB policies, as well as those of the host university. 
Failure to comply with the appropriate rules and procedures may affect your UC 
and EAP status, as well as your College of Engineering degree progress and your 
status in your major.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN><A name=2></A><SPAN 
class=subsectiontitle1 style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><B>How Long to be 
Abroad</B></SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><BR><BR>There 
are basically three lengths of time to study abroad; one semester, an academic 
year or summer session. Depending on what your goals are when on EAP, you should 
carefully choose an option that meets those plans and how that fits in with your 
College of Engineering program.<BR><BR>Please note that entering freshmen are 
normally allowed eight semesters to graduate and entering junior transfers are 
normally allowed four semesters to graduate. If a student needs an extra 
semester to graduate, he/she must petition to do so. When a student is away for 
a full year, it requires careful planning to complete the remaining requirements 
of their engineering major as the EAP semesters count towards 
graduation.<BR><BR>Look carefully at the courses offered at different schools, 
as you will find that some programs are more compatible with your major and 
breadth requirements. You should be familiar with how to use courses for major 
or college requirements (see <A 
href="http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/current_students/eap.html#9#9"><SPAN 
style="COLOR: #0000cf">How To Determine Which EAP Courses Might Count For 
Major/Minor Or College Requirements</SPAN></A>). You may also want to think 
about taking some summer session classes.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN><A name=3></A><SPAN 
class=subsectiontitle1 style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><B>When to 
Go</B></SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><BR><BR>The 
traditional time to go abroad is at the start of junior year, but EAP has 
created numerous summer and semester programs geared toward sophomores who need 
to fulfill breadth requirements (London, Rome, Paris) or for those who want to 
learn a language (eg Germany, Italy, Korea and many others).<BR><BR>Freshmen can 
apply as early as January to participate in EAP's sophomore oriented programs 
that start in summer of fall of their second year. Students who choose to wait 
until the senior year may still be able to successfully incorporate study abroad 
into their degree program, though travel in senior year may affect graduation 
plans (See box: <A 
href="http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/current_students/eap.html#8#8"><SPAN 
style="COLOR: #0000cf">Transferring EAP Courses Back To 
Cal</SPAN></A>).<BR><BR>Senior residency is an important Berkeley campus and 
College requirement: At least 30 units must be taken on campus at Berkeley, in 
no fewer than two semesters, after you have reached 90 units. You need to 
discuss this requirement and possible ways to fulfill it with your Student 
Affairs Adviser (308 McLaughlin Hall).<BR><BR><BR></SPAN><A name=4></A><B><SPAN 
class=subsectiontitle1 style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">What to 
Study</SPAN></B><SPAN 
style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><B><BR></B><BR>We highly value the 
study abroad learning experience. We encourage you to take a balanced load of 
engineering and non-engineering courses, completing remaining breadth 
requirements, fulfilling upper division requirements, etc. While we try to be 
flexible about granting credit for work done abroad, there are some guidelines 
to keep in mind. Transferability of course work isn't an issue for students at 
EAP campuses, but students on non-EAP exchanges must look into this. Students in 
all programs need to keep in mind that Berkeley will not necessarily grant the 
number of units listed in an international catalog. The advisors in the EAP 
office and the Office of Undergraduate Admission can give you more information 
about transferability of credit.<BR><BR>It is also important to consider whether 
a course can be used for major requirements. In terms of engineering classes, 
there are clearly some courses that are easier to see as equivalent to the 
College of Engineering courses than others. All courses need to be evaluated by 
the department before credit is given. If the student can obtain a course 
syllabus prior to leaving, they should see if the course is equivalent by 
obtaining a course evaluation form from their Student Affairs Adviser. This will 
let the student know before hand if they will receive full subject credit, 
receive partial subject credit whereby the student will need to complete a 
bridge course in order to fulfill the subject requirement or receive no subject 
credit. If this is done after the student returns, they risk taking 
inappropriate courses (see <A 
href="http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/current_students/eap.html#9#9"><SPAN 
style="COLOR: #0000cf">How To Determine Which EAP Courses Might Count For 
Major/Minor Or College Requirements</SPAN></A>). Your Student Affairs Adviser 
can assist you with your academic plan. Remember all courses used to fulfill 
major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN><A

suggested models for study abroad which may be compatible with your the College 
of Engineering degree program. There are advantages and disadvantages to each 
and you will need to consider carefully which best meets your needs.

style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><BR><BR>The Education Abroad Program 
(EAP) is a University of California, system-wide study abroad program 
administered from a main office at UC Santa Barbara, with an on-campus office at 
160 Stephens Hall. One of the advantages of this program is that the courses you 
take transfer straight to your Berkeley transcript and GPA. Better yet, you pay 
Berkeley fees and continue to be eligible for all financial aid.<BR><BR>The 
drawbacks to EAP include that many of the universities or countries that are of 
interest to you may not be offered through EAP. Some of the programs are 
"Academic Year Only," although one-semester programs continue to be added. The 
EAP advising staff can give guidance concerning your target 
countries.<BR><BR>Please see the <A href="http://www.eap.ucop.edu/"><SPAN 
style="COLOR: #0000cf">EAP web page</SPAN></A>, visit the countries you are 
interested in, and see the students' comments. In many cases, you will even be 
able to go to the host university's web site for detailed information and some 
nice pictures. EAP also provides information about programs that may be of 
particular interest to engineering students.<BR><B><BR></B></SPAN><B><SPAN 
class=subsectiontitle1 style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Non-EAP 
Programs</SPAN></B><SPAN 
style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><BR><BR>There is some reference 
material on non-EAP Programs in the Study Abroad library in Stephens 
Hall.<BR><BR>The <A href="http://www.ciee.org/"><SPAN 
style="COLOR: #0000cf">Council on International Educational Exchange</SPAN></A> 
is an additional off-campus resource: They run some non-EAP programs and can 
help with documentation. Finally, there is usually a Study Abroad Fair, 
sponsored by the EAP office, in central campus in late September or early 
October.<BR><BR>General: Participating in a program that is not EAP involves 
"withdrawing" from Berkeley for one or two semesters, and then having a planned 
readmission. The correct word to use here is "Cancellation." Before studying 
abroad, you are required to cancel your planned enrollment for the next semester 
(when you will be away). You should also pre-file an application for 
readmission. This should not cause you any difficulty if you have good 
communication with your Student Affairs Adviser.<BR><BR>Since you are not 
on-campus, you don't pay Berkeley fees, but are responsible for the full fees 
<B>and tuition</B> required by the program you select at your host institution 
(at non-resident rates, too). Some, but not all, financial aid may still be 
available to you. You should check with the Financial Aid Office as soon as 
possible.<BR><BR><B>Before you leave, you should read and complete the 
Information for UC Berkeley Students Planning to Study Abroad in Non-UC 
Sponsored Programs available in the EAP Office, 160 Stephens Hall.</B> It will 
be very helpful in transferring credit on your return, however please note that 
the units just show as a block, eg. "Study at the Leeds University, 30 credits 
granted." <O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>

</SPAN>Financial Aid: Many financial aid programs will continue to fund your 
education even if you are not on the Berkeley campus, but international travel 
can be expensive depending on the country and program you choose. If you receive 
financial aid, please check with the Financial Aid Office, 211 Sproul Hall, 
about which scholarships and grants are still available to you while you are 
off-campus and fill out any necessary forms. (Some aid sources require a Leave 
of Absence Request, for example.) It is very important to think about the costs 
of living abroad and travel, in addition to tuition for non-EAP programs (and 
for EAP if you are a non-resident), when analyzing your financial 
situation.<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>

</SPAN>Language of Instruction: The good news is that English is used at many of 
the EAP institutions. However, if you want to increase your language skills, 
make sure you haven't selected a school abroad where the official language of 
instruction is English. On the other hand, keep in mind that the language skills 
necessary for studying, writing papers and taking exams in a foreign language 
are greater than the skills needed for recreational travel.<O:P>

</SPAN>What You See isn't always What You Get: There are many excellent study 
abroad programs which are run by US universities. But there are some, heavily

misleading. Be sure to thoroughly check out all non-EAP programs by contacting 
the sponsoring university and ask detailed questions that matter to you and what
